# Project Title
### Department Time Table Generator
# Abstract
#### Lots of courses are floated in a Department of an Institute. Creating a department timetable for classes is a very hectic & daunting task. To overcome that problem, I started this project. In this project, the code takes some information as input(for example, the total number of courses; for each course: course code, Teacher code, L-T-P-C distribution). These courses can belong to different standards, and according to the standards, course codes need to be set. With this information, the code will print a Timetable of classes for five working days with respective teacher codes in the console.
#### I created this whole project in C Programming language. This project is a good application of memory management. Also, it gives good fundamental knowledge of Nested Structure with pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation, and especially character pointers. Continuous memory allocation and class insertion are followed here as the primary class allocation method to each standard for each working hour of each working day. This class allocation is entirely random; every time we run the program, we get a different Timetable for all the same courses.
