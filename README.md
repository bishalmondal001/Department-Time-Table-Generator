# Project Title
### Department Time Table Generator
# Abstract
#### Huge number of courses are floated in a Department of an Institute.The Creation of a timetable of courses in a department is a very hectic & daunting task.To overcome that problem I created this project.In this project the code takes some information as input(for example,total no. of courses , for each course: course code, Teacher code, L-T-P-C distribution).The courses can belong to different standards and according to the standard, course code need to be set.With this informations given , according to courses L-T-P-C structure a Timetable of coursees for 5 working days with respective teacher code will be printed in the console.
#### This whole project is created in **C Programming language**.This project is a good application of memory management.Also gives good fundamental knowledge of Nested Structure with pointers,Dynamic Memory Allocation and specially character pointer.Continuos memory allocation and class insertion is followed here as main class allocation method to each standard for each working hour of each working day.This class allocation is completely random and as a result everytime we run the programme ,we will get different Timetable for all that same courses.
